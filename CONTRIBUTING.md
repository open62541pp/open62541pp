## Development setup

```shell
# create build directory
mkdir build
cd build

# configure with recommended project options for development (sanitizers require GCC or Clang)
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug \
      -DUAPP_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=ON \
      -DUAPP_BUILD_EXAMPLES=ON \
      -DUAPP_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
      -DUAPP_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY=ON \
      -DUAPP_ENABLE_SANITIZER_ADDRESS=ON \
      -DUAPP_ENABLE_SANITIZER_UNDEFINED=ON \
      -DUAPP_WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS=ON \
      ..
# or use ccmake/cmake-gui to toggle the project options

# build
cmake --build .

# run tests
ctest --output-on-failure
```

Defined checks can be automatically executed before committing with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com):

```shell
# install pre-commit
pip install pre-commit
# install git hook scripts defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
pre-commit install
# (optionally) run against all the files
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Code style

Please use both and `clang-tidy` and `clang-format` during development.
The provided configs `.clang-tidy` and `.clang-format` will enforce modern C++, best practises and uniform formatting.
